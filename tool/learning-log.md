* This is the tutorial that I followed today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM. Finished step 1-2 only
* Learned to write in C# and add properties to gameobjects. After that, I played around with different properties to see what it does to the gameobjects.
  
**Notes:**
- Project panel - contains sprites, sound effect, scripts, etc.
- Hierarchy panel  - contains all the stuffs in the current scene.
- Inspector panel - changing properties of gameobjects.
- Scene panel - shows what is in the current scene.
- Void Start () - runs the code inside once soon as the script is enabled.
- Void Update () - runs constantly and will run every line of code inside it, every single frame.

- My next step is try to finish this tutorial and move on finding new tutorials to follow.

* Continue of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM. Finished step 3.
* Learned how to spawn and move gameobject using C#. After that, I played around with the rate and properties to see what it does to the gameobjects.

**Notes**
- Drag gameObject to the project creates prefabricated gameobject (blueprint)
- Debug.Log() - sends message to the console
- Destroy() - deletes gameobject

- My next step is to finish part 4 and 5 of the tutorial
