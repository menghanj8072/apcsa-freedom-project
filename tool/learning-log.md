* The tutorial I followed today was https://youtu.be/on9nwbZngyw?si=o9218hhajvdi9a0U
* Learned how to import free assets from unity store, how to use tile plattes. After that, I made a own game scene using the free sprites from asset.
  
11/19/2023
* This is the tutorial that I followed today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM. Finished step 1-2 only
* Learned to write in C# and add properties to gameobjects. After that, I played around with different properties to see what it does to the gameobjects.
  
**Notes:**
- Project panel - contains sprites, sound effect, scripts, etc.
- Hierarchy panel  - contains all the stuffs in the current scene.
- Inspector panel - changing properties of gameobjects.
- Scene panel - shows what is in the current scene.
- Void Start () - runs the code inside once soon as the script is enabled.
- Void Update () - runs constantly and will run every line of code inside it, every single frame.

- My next step is try to finish this tutorial and move on finding new tutorials to follow.

* Continue of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM. Finished step 3.
* Learned how to spawn and move gameobject using C#. After that, I played around with the rate and properties to see what it does to the gameobjects.

**Notes**
- Drag gameObject to the project creates prefabricated gameobject (blueprint)
- Debug.Log() - sends message to the console
- Destroy() - deletes gameobject

- My next step is to finish part 4 and 5 of the tutorial

12/10/2023
* Continue of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM. Finished step 4 and 5
* Learned how to add collisions and add game over screen. After that, I played around with the collision setting by changing the size of the collision area.

**Notes**
- To add UI into the game, need to include `UnityEngine.UI` on top of the script.
- `Tag` is used to reference a component when one of the gameobject is not in the scene.
- Public function can run from another script, but need to add reference

- My next step is to either find a new tutorial to follow or continue building on the game with some recommended ideas from the tutorial creator.

* New tutorial I'm currently following is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFayQioG71A.
* Learned different types of variables, accessor, how to write function, conditional, array, arraylist, loop and class in C#. 
*I finished this tutorial. It was very quick one. I found out that C# is very similar to Java.

-My next step is to search new tutorial to practice writing C#.
