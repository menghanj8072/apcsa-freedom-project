* The tutorial I followed today was https://youtu.be/on9nwbZngyw?si=o9218hhajvdi9a0U
* Learned how to import free assets from unity store, how to use tile plattes. After that, I made a own game scene using the free sprites from asset.
  
11/19/2023
* This is the tutorial that I followed today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM. Finished step 1-2 only
* Learned to write in C# and add properties to gameobjects. After that, I played around with different properties to see what it does to the gameobjects.

**Notes:**
- Project panel - contains sprites, sound effect, scripts, etc.
- Hierarchy panel  - contains all the stuffs in the current scene.
- Inspector panel - changing properties of gameobjects.
- Scene panel - shows what is in the current scene.
- Void Start () - runs the code inside once soon as the script is enabled.
- Void Update () - runs constantly and will run every line of code inside it, every single frame.

- My next step is try to finish this tutorial and move on finding new tutorials to follow.

* Continue of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM. Finished step 3.
* Learned how to spawn and move gameobject using C#. After that, I played around with the rate and properties to see what it does to the gameobjects.

**Notes**
- Drag gameObject to the project creates prefabricated gameobject (blueprint)
- Debug.Log() - sends message to the console
- Destroy() - deletes gameobject

- My next step is to finish part 4 and 5 of the tutorial

12/10/2023
* Continue of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM. Finished step 4 and 5
* Learned how to add collisions and add game over screen. After that, I played around with the collision setting by changing the size of the collision area.

**Notes**
- To add UI into the game, need to include `UnityEngine.UI` on top of the script.
- `Tag` is used to reference a component when one of the gameobject is not in the scene.
- Public function can run from another script, but need to add reference

- My next step is to either find a new tutorial to follow or continue building on the game with some recommended ideas from the tutorial creator.

* New tutorial I'm currently following is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFayQioG71A.
* Learned different types of variables, accessor, how to write function, conditional, array, arraylist, loop and class in C#.
* I finished this tutorial. It was very quick one. I found out that C# is very similar to Java.

-My next step is to search new tutorial to practice writing C#.

* New tutorial I'm currently following is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tMvzrqBUP8
* I didn't finish the tutorial
  
What I learned so far from this tutorial:
* Destroy(gameobject, time) - destroy gameobjects
* OnMouseDown() - detects mouse click
* Input. - to get keyboard inputs
* AddForce() - adding force to a gameobject
* .Velocity - adds velocity to a gameobject

- My next step is to finish this tutorial and move on planning for MVP.

3/3/2024
* In the past few weeks, I have finished the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tMvzrqBUP8) that I didn't finish last time. I also spent some time working on my MVP.
* I didn't tried to create something on my own. What I have tried was creating the same example as the guy did in the video for the part about collision.

**Notes**
* To load a new scene to the game, we have to add unityEngine.SceneManagement.
* .getAxis() - gets value from the axis. Example: input.getAxis("Horizontial") gives the horizontal axis values.

- My next step is to continue working on my MVP and maybe move on searching tutorials about animation in 2d unity.

3/10/2024
* The new tutorial I'm following right now is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkaysu1Z-N8&t=182s.
* I didn't go far in tutorial. I download the assets and had to spend sometime figuring out the settings for animation, since I have different version of unity compare to the one in the video. I will spend some time search recent year videos about animation in 2d unity to understand the animation settings.

* My next step is to continue following the tutorial and also working on my MVP.
