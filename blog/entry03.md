# Entry 3
##### 2/12/2024
As mentioned in blog 2 that I will be finding tutorials that teaches how to write C#. One tutorial that I have been following recently was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFayQioG71A. In this tutorial, I learned different types of variables, accessor, how to write function, conditional, array, arraylist, loop and class in C#. During my process of learning, I notice that C# is very similar to Java. They use very similar syntaxes and also both are object oriented. Since they are similar, I finished this tutorial very quickly. 

One takeaway from this tutorial is the **switch** conditional. When using switch conditional, the value of the conditional is being compared with each value of **case**. The **default:** code will run, if the values of the conditional does not match with the **cases**.

Here is what I tried with it:
```C#
int num = 5;
Switch(num){
case 1:
	Console.WriteLine(“January”);
	break;
case 2:
	Console.WriteLine(“February”);
	break;
case 3:
	Console.WriteLine(“March”);
	break;
case 4:
	Console.WriteLine(“April”);
	break;
case 5:
	Console.WriteLine(“May”);
	break;
}

//Output will be May
```
My next step would be to finish up the new tutorials I have been following recently and also start to plan out the character and the game environment for my MVP.

For the engineering design process, I'm still in step **2 research the problem** because I'm still researching for more tutorials to follow to learn more about my tool. One new skill I have developed is **Attention to detail** because when I was writing case for switch conditional, I often forgot to add the colon symbol after it. This mistake made me pay more attention to syntax when writing code.
