# Entry 3
##### 2/12/2024
As mentioned in blog 2 that I will be finding tutorials that teaches how to write C#. One tutorial that I have been following recently was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFayQioG71A. In this tutorial, I learned different types of variables, accessor, how to write function, conditional, array, arraylist, loop and class in C#. During my process of learning, I notice that C# is very similar to Java. They use very similar syntaxes and also both are object oriented. Since they are similar, I finished this tutorial very quickly.
