# Entry 5
##### 5/6/2024

After the last blog, I have been spending time following tutorials on how to create animation and how to switch levels in unity and also working on my MVP. In the tutorial about how to create animation, I learned that I need to create animated sprites first in order to turn them into animation in unity. So I spent some time drawing animated sprites and importing each frame into unity. I designed my sprites on https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite. After importing them, I first created an animation for the player sprite. I drag the sprites onto the animation panel and adjust the speed of animation by changing the frames per second. When I finished adding animation to the player sprite, I moved on and added animation for the enemy sprites. Once I finished with animations, I moved on adding components to my sprites and code.

### Player Sprite
I added 2 components to the player sprite: Rigidbody 2D and Box Collider 2D. What rigidbody2D does is it allows the gameobject to act under the control of physics and for box collider 2D is used for collision physics. After doing that I created a script for player and started adding code. My goal for the player is being able to move, jump, lose health and collect coins.

### Coin

### Player Health



I’m now in step **5 creating a prototype** and step **6 tests and evaluating the prototype** in the **engineering design process.** One new skill I learned is debugging because when I finished my mvp, I noticed there were many bugs in my game. I have debugged some bugs, but I still need to fix more when I’m working on beyond MVP. Fixing those bugs will give the player a good experience when playing the game.
