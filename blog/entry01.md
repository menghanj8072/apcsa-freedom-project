  For this years freedom project, I'm deciding to use Unity to make a 2D platformer game. I have seen many famous games are made using unity, so that's why I'm choosing to use this tool. In the past weeks, I have been reading documentations on [unity offical website](https://unity.com/) as well as following tutorials on youtube. The one tutorial I was following was called [How to make a 2D game in unity](https://youtu.be/on9nwbZngyw?si=o9218hhajvdi9a0U). In this tutorial, I learned how to import free assets from unity asset store and how to use tile plattes. The asset contains sprites and I learned how to import the sprites into my own game scene. Then I use the same sprites and created tile plattes to make my own game scene. 

  I'm currently in stage **2 research the problem** in the engineering design process. My goal was to understand more about the tool that I choosed. In addition, I also learned two skills which is "**How to learn**" and "**How to Google**". These two are the skills I learned because I'm researching tutorials relates to my idea and I'm using the tutorials to help me learn about my tool.
