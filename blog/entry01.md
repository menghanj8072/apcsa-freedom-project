  For this years freedom project, I'm deciding to use Unity to make a 2D platformer game. I have seen many famous games are made using unity, so that's why I'm choosing to use this tool. In the past weeks, I have been reading documentations on unity offical website as well as following tutorials on youtube. The one tutorial I was following was called [How to make a 2D game in unity](https://youtu.be/on9nwbZngyw?si=o9218hhajvdi9a0U). In this tutorial, I learned how to import free assets from unity asset store and how to use tile plattes.
