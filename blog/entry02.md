After finish following the first tutorial, I went to search for a new one to follow. The second tutorial I found was [The Unity Tutorial For Complete Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM). This tutorial teaches the basic of 2D in unity through a simple flappy bird game. The tutorial was broken down into 5 parts. In part I and II of the tutorial, I learned about unity UI and some physics + programming in unity. There are four panels that made up the default UI layout: project, hierarchy, inspector, and scene panel. Each panel contains differrent things in it.
* Project panel - contains sprites, sound effect, scripts, etc.
* Hierarchy panel - contains all the stuffs in the current scene.
* Inspector panel - changing properties of gameobjects.
* Scene panel - shows what is in the current scene.
