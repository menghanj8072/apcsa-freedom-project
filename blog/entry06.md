# Entry 6
##### 6/7/2024
In the last blog, I mentioned how I finished my MVP for my freedom project. Now that I have finished my project, I have to present my project in class as well as in EXPO. In the EXPO presentation, there will be judges walking around checking everyoneâ€™s project and rate their projects. To prepare for the EXPO presentation, I have done the same thing that I have done for the past few years in SEP which is to make an elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is a short script of what you will be saying in a presentation. Here is my elevator pitch for my EXPO presentation:
```
Hello!
This is my freedom project. It's a simple 2D platformer game.I made this game using the Unity 2D game engine. The objective in this game is to avoid the enemies and collect all the coins in the current level to move on to the next level. The player only has 3 healths. If you lose all your health, the game is over. You can move the player by pressing the WASD key and space key to jump.
Do you have any questions?
```

During the EXPO presentation, I have received a lot of good feedback not only from the judges, but also from people who are not judges in this presentation. One of the important takeaways from this presentation is to be able to explain the purpose of the project. This gives the audience a better understanding of why you made this project. After finishing the EXPO, I have to present my project in class. For this presentation, I was required to make google slides. [This is the link to my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qY2NshZXuGptx4GbHIlII8QKRh3Xx4VYfkNkhpxLmto/edit). My takeaway from this presentation is the same as the feedback for improvements that my teacher gave me, which is to speak louder and make eye contact with the audience.

This year I had a lot of fun making my freedom project. Presenting in class and in EXPO puts me in stage **8 communicating the result** in the engineering design process. Presenting my projects to others had helped me improve my skill of  **communication** as I need to communicate with audiences to get feedback to improve my presentation or project.
